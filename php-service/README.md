# PHP Service

In this folder, a PHP-based backend service will be implemented.
This service is planned to handle features such as user registration, login, and communication with the main database.
It will work together with the main application to manage authentication and data exchange.

I still have a question regarding this part:
Should I already start creating this service (for example, setting up registration and login with a database),
or should I first wait for further instructions on how it should be integrated with the rest of the project?
